As a developer, you've been granted access to the APls of five distinct e-commerce companies. Your objective is to develop a responsive React Frontend Web Application that showcases the top N products sold by these companies.

• While ordinarily, registration with each e-commerce company is required separately for your startup, the test server simplifies this process by allowing you to register through a single api for all companies simultaneously.

subject to change by the respective e-commerce companies. Generate a custom unique product identifier for the data received to uniquely identify a single product.
• The all products page must support filtration based on category, e-commerce company, rating, price range, and availability. Products should be sorted by price, rating, discount, and paginated to ensure efficient navigation.
• Employ a random assortment of images as product illustrations for both pages.
• Each API call made by your server to the Test Server incurs a cost and will negatively impact the score you are awarded in this test.
• Your users should receive a timely, performance and accurate response. Therefore, any attempt to minimise costs shouldn't be at the expense of your user's experience or by inaccurately displaying stale product data on your pages
• Your frontend application should solely consume the Test server API to obtain product data and not utilise any third-party APls.
• Utilise any CSS library of your preference such as Material Ul, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, etc. Not utilising a CSS library or relying solely on native CSS will result in lower scores.
